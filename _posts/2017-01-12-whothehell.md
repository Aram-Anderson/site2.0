I'm learning to talk to computers. That's life right now. I really like it quite a lot, and though I'm far from good at it, it feels satisfying. In the Fall of 2017, I'll be attending <a href= "http://www.turing.io"> The Turing School. </a> In the meantime, I'll probably write some lengthy (and likely patently absurd) blog posts about my thoughts on the philosophy of this kind of activity as I see it. I just have to work up the hubris to convince myself I understand anything well enough to talk about it.

I've worn a lot of hats in life...both figuratively and literally. Mostly baseball caps in the literal, though I don't wear them much these days. I'm trying to care about my hair. I'm trying to care about a lot of things. In the figurative hat department it's been mostly calloused hands and dirt under my nails. I've been an aircraft mechanic for the government of these here United States (contract work, uniform provided, job security for 4 *long* years), a car mechanic, a boat mechanic, and a heavy equipment mechanic in a big underground mine. That one was weird, and I can't say I would recommend it. It's not good for you if you like being a well adjusted human. I've also made my living building custom model railroads for rich old dudes. That was cool. I ran my own custom furniture company that consisted of precisely one employee (me). In that endeavor I mostly learned that I'm not good at business, and I really just like making stuff. Unfortunately, that is not a realization that equaled money, so I closed up shop.

My education is in sociology and philosophy, which I was surprised to learn is not especially highly valued in our economic system. Imagine my shock! Philosophy does, however, lend itself well to coding. It's lots of little logic problems, and so is philosophy since Descartes. Maybe all those student loans will pay off after all.
