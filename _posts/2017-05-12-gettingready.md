Shit is getting real. I have just over a month before I start Turing, and I'm feeling like it's actually happening. Up to now, this has all seemed a little fuzzy in my brain. It's something I knew was going to happen, but it didn't feel solid. There was a buffer between now and then which seemed like it would go on forever.

I went to the school yesterday to pick up my laptop for the program. I'd been using a macbook that was about 8 years old, and: A. it didn't meet the tech specs for the program, B. it has been showing its age lately. Lots of crashing and weird bugs. I'll probably set my old laptop up as a Windows machine to run my laser cutter full time. I can't do that with a Mac.

I also recently got the email from Turing that lays out all the logistics for what to do prior to start, and the first day. The prework looks enjoyable, and I've started working on some of that. Some of it is stuff I've already done, so I'm a little ahead of the curve.

I was approved for the <a href="http://www.tecpcolorado.com/job-seekers"> TEC-P grant </a> yesterday. That was huge for me. For various reasons, the deferred payment plan at Turing is what made sense for my situation, and that meant a sizable upfront payment. I've been saving for the occasion, but the grant means I got that upfront payment taken care of. That's going to be make a real difference in my experience in the program. It will help keep some of the external stressors of life at bay. The application process for TEC-P was a little less than straight forward, but both the TEC-P rep and the staff at Turing (especially Rachel) were beyond helpful.

Picking up the laptop yesterday was also the first time I'd seen the new facility Turing is in. It's substantially different than the old, and I didn't see much of it. At first blush, I like the old one better. It had way more of a scrappy feel and far more character. But I also understand why it was untenable to stay in that space. There wasn't even enough room for both the frontend and backend programs. And again, I only got a glimpse of the new. I would imagine that from a practical perspective, the new one is way better for both staff and students. There's a lot more room, it's a lot quieter, and it looks easier to find a space to zone out on what you're doing without a million distractions. Every startup that makes it moves out of the garage eventually.

I'm definitely getting excited. I think it's going to be an amazing opportunity. I'm really looking forward to diving headfirst into learning, and spending a lot of time doing nothing but immersing myself in new ideas. It's been a quite a while since I've had that chance, and even in college I was usually working full time. This is going to be hard, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.
