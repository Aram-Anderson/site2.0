This site is my first attempt at building something for the internet that didn't come out of a point and click website builder. Not that there's anything wrong with those things, they're just fine if wading through the weeds of website creation isn't your preferred method of time wasting.

I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll </a> to build this one. All in all it's been a great process. Jekyll takes a lot of the pain out of the build process, and the install is quite simple. Jekyll creates a static site, so it's somewhat limited, but for my needs at the moment, it's just fine. Jekyll is a simple framework that gives you a good starting point to work with, and lets you create your posts in markdown. The documentation is good, and there's ample information out there if you get a little lost. Plus, themes abound. I was playing with one called <a href="https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme"> Hmfaysal Omega, </a> which turned out to be far more complex than what I need, but gives a great show of just how powerful a Jekyll site can be.

--As an aside, my next challenge is going to be adding a comment field to the posts. I'm fairly sure there are a few ways to do that. Feel free to get in touch if you have a good idea there. I kind of hate the Disqus platform, mostly because it's ugly. *** ***Edit...I added Disqus. It's not that bad. We'll see if anyone uses it*** *** Comments may just end up being a thing that happens when I make this thing over in Rails sometime down the road.--

I followed <a target= "_blank" href= "https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/"> Tania Rascia's </a> tutorial for a good deal of guidance on putting it together, and ended up just forking her <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/taniarascia/startjekyll/'> theme </a> as a starting point. It's a nice minimalist theme, and I'll probably add to it over time.

I'm hosting on Github, which is also quite painless. It's quite easy to set the site up with my own domain name, and it's free hosting. For my needs, it's more than adequate. Plus, it's one stop shopping to make edits, deal with hosting, and create posts. Good deal!
