When I made the choice that come hell or high water, I was going to learn to code, I was faced with a vast landscape of totally foreign concepts. It can be daunting to even take that first step. I didn't have a real network of people embedded in the programming world, so I couldn't ask a real person (for the most part). I did what people do and started visiting internet forums, reading blogs, and poking around on <a href="https://codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>. I googled "what's the best programming language to learn?" That, as I'm sure we all know, really leads to some useful information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin's Law</a> was proven early and often in that search. I eventually settled on Python. That choice essentially boils down to throwing a dart at a random assortment of languages, and going with the one I hit.
