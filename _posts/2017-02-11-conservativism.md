Conservatism, at its heart, is an ideology rooted in weakness. It is an ideology that gathers all it is from timidity. Conservatism seeks to maintain the traditions of the world, to fight progress, to fear what it does not know, and that is a mission for the weak.

I have no room in my mind for those who fear the future, and fight to prevent change. Existence is not static, nor will it ever be. Those people in society who are unable to see this basic fact about our experience as human beings are fighting an impossible battle in the name of a reality that does not now, nor did ever exist. Nostalgia can be poison. Conservatism is political nostalgia. 

We will win, because the very fabric of reality is on our side.
